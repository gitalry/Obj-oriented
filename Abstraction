Abstraction
Abstraction is the development of classes, objects, types in terms of their interfaces and functionality, instead of their implementation details. It denotes a model, a view, or some other focused representation for an actual item. They hide the details of their implementation
Data abstraction is closely tied together with encapsulation.
